"On, February" 2, 1876, the schooner "Pilgrim" was in latitude 43° 57' south, and in
longitude 165° 19' west of the meridian of Greenwich.
This vessel, of four hundred tons, fitted out at San Francisco for whale-fishing in the
southern seas, belonged to James W. Weldon, a rich Californian ship-owner, who
had for several years intrusted the command of it to Captain Hull.
The "Pilgrim" was one of the smallest, but one of the best of that flotilla, which James
W. Weldon sent each season, not only beyond Behring Strait, as far as the northern
seas, but also in the quarters of Tasmania or of Cape Horn, as far as the Antarctic
Ocean. She sailed in a superior manner sailor. Her very easily managed rigging permitted
her to venture, with a few men, in sight of the impenetrable fields of ice of the
southern hemisphere. Captain Hull knew how to disentangle himself, as the sailors
say, from among those icebergs, which, during the summer, drift by the way of New
Zealand or the Cape of Good Hope, under a much lower latitude than that which
they reach in the northern seas of the globe. It is true that only icebergs of small
dimensions were found there; they were already worn by collisions, eaten away by
the warm waters, and the greater number of them were going to melt in the Pacific or
the Atlantic.
Under the command of Captain Hull, a good seaman, and also one of the most
skilful harpooners of the flotilla, was a crew composed of five sailors and a novice. It
was a small number for this whale-fishing, which requires a good many persons.
